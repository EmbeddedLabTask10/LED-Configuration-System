# Aim
LEDs have a strict need for the right voltage and the right current. So, the correct series of resistors has to be selected by calculation.

Arduino-based device should take on any LED and measure the operation point voltage.

Information about the LED, including recommendations for a series of resistors at different source voltages should be displayed.
